### [Full Project Description](doc/project4_desc.md)

+ Project summary: In this project, we created an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output. We focus on post-processing which includes two tasks: error detection and error correction. We will conduct this analysis in the following steps: (1) error detection, (2) error correction, (3) candidates selection, (4) comparison between MLE and ELE, and (5) evaluation and performance measure.

+ Papers: Our assigned papers are (1) [Probability Scoring for Spelling Correction](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-Project4-sec1--section1-project4_group1/blob/master/doc/paper/C-4.pdf) and (2) [On Retrieving Legal Files](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-Project4-sec1--section1-project4_group1/blob/master/doc/paper/D-1.pdf).

* Main Submission: We prepared an integrated document in RMD format. Please click [link](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-Project4-sec1--section1-project4_group1/blob/master/doc/main.Rmd). We will mainly be using PPT for presentation. Please click [here](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-Project4-sec1--section1-project4_group1/blob/master/doc/ADS-Project4-Group1.pptx).

First, we will walk through our audience step-by-step process of how we detect errors after processed files. We take the the proposed methods from paper (1) and we present in detail the steps needed to search for the text errors. Method 4 in the paper has a flaw of deteting words like "by", "my" etc. that these words will return false. Thus, we improve the method by only detecting letters greater than 3 characters, and it returns better detection of errors.

Next, we will present our analysis on error correction. We will specifically use paper (2) and we compute, with great details, the four probabilities required to correct the errors. Based on the corpus, we build our own confusion matrix and calculate the denominator of P(typo|cor) according to the bayesian method.

Furthermore, we create this visualization to conclude the algorithm of selecting the best candidate. For each possible candidate, we have 4 lists corresponding to P(t|c), P(c), P(l|c), P(r|c) respectively that have exactly the same shape. We multiply the 4 lists with each of the element and the greatest score will be the one we chose for the error correction.

In the evaluation part, we estimate the word-wise and character-wise recall and precision for MLE and ELE methods. The result shows that both correction methods perform better than original Tesseract with approximately 2% and 3% improvement respectively. Another advanced method called Good-Turing would perform better according to another paper refered by the author, and it is encouraged to evlauate GT method in the future.

**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 

We also want to thank Professor Ying Liu and Professor Tian Zheng for hosting lectures of Advanced Data Science this semester. It is with transcending gratitude that we announce here what an inspiration both professors have been throughout our experience of building this project. Their knowledge, understanding and genuine “care” for others is illuminated in everything they do! We, Group 1, are in forever debt for their teachings. Moreoever, we also want to thank TA, Chengliang Tang. There is not enough we can say about how much we thank heaven that he is our teaching assistance. His patience and understanding are unsurpassed. We are grateful for being his students.
